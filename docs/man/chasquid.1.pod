=head1 FILES

The daemon's configuration is by default in F</etc/chasquid/>, and can be
changed with the I<-config_dir> flag.

Inside that directory, the daemon expects the following structure:

=over 8

=item F<chasquid.conf>

Main config file, see chasquid.conf(5).

=item F<domains/>

Per-domain configuration.

=item F<domains/example.com/>

Domain-specific configuration. Can be empty.

=item F<domains/example.com/users>

User and password database for this domain.

=item F<domains/example.com/aliases>

Aliases for the domain.

=item F<certs/>

Certificates to use, one directory per pair.

=item F<certs/mx.example.com/>

Certificates for this domain.

=item F<certs/mx.example.com/fullchain.pem>

Certificate (full chain).

=item F<certs/mx.example.com/privkey.pem>

Private key.

=back

Note the F<certs/> directory layout matches the one from certbot (client for
Let's Encrypt CA), so you can just symlink F<certs/> to
F</etc/letsencrypt/live>.

Make sure the user you use to run chasquid under ("mail" in the example
config) can access the certificates and private keys.
