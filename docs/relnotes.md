noting backward-incompatible changes or known security issues.

## 0.03 (2017-07-15)

**Backwards-incompatible changes:**

- The default MTA binary has changed. It's now maildrop by default.
  If you relied on procmail being the default, add the following to
  `/etc/chasquid/chasquid.conf`: `mail_delivery_agent_bin: "procmail"`.
- chasquid now listens on a third port, submission-on-TLS.
  If using systemd, copy the `etc/systemd/system/chasquid-submission_tls.socket`
  file to `/etc/systemd/system/`, and start it.


Release notes:

- Support submission (directly) over TLS (submissions/smtps/port 465).
- Change the default MDA binary to `maildrop`.
- Add a very basic MDA that uses LMTP to do the mail delivery.
